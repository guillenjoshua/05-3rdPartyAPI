I felt much better about this homework. At first, I had trouble with the textarea and assigning id's. Initially my data-id and id did not match so i was unable to save all rows into local storage, actually had data-index within the textarea.  Once I got that figured out, getting them to stay on the page was a challenge.  The for loop confused me, I was setting my index to currentTime as opposed to i in getItem and I did not include val().  I was also calling my highlight function within the highlight function itself instead of within the for loop.   This assignment helped clarify alot of confusion I had with jQuery and localStorage.
